                  <p><strong><img alt="" class="float-left" src="http://www.icter.org/conference/sites/default/files//profilepic/adithya.jpg"><a href="http://www.icter.org/conference/masahito_hirakawa">Professor </a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.icter.org/conference/masahito_hirakawa">Aditya Mathur</a></strong><strong>, </strong><em>Professor and Head of Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design [SUTD], Singapore</em></p>
                  <p>An increasing frequency of unauthorized attempts to intrude into public infrastructure with (possibly) malicious intent has led to heightened research activity aimed at the design of safe and secure Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). In this talk, we focus on work related to the design and testing of systems such as water purification and smart grid using testbeds under construction at SUTD. We examine attacker models and potential attacks, and dwell on how one could test CPS to ensure their safety and security. We will also examine novel ideas of CPS defense and testing based on physical and logical invariants, hardware and software mutations that we call attacklets, and device-specific intelligent checkers. Our proposed methodology for CPS testing is aimed at generating suitable metrics for assessing the level of security and safety of a CPS and to assist designers in creating layered cyber defense infrastructure.</p>

                  <p><strong><img alt="" class="float-left" src="http://www.icter.org/conference/sites/default/files//profilepic/ajith.jpg"><a href="http://www.icter.org/conference/profile/dr_ajith_abraham#overlay-context=keynote_speeches">Dr.Ajith Abraham,</a> </strong>Director - Machine Intelligence Research Labs (MIR Labs), Washington, USA</p>
                  <p>Abstract : We are blessed with the sophisticated technological artifacts that are enriching our daily lives and the society. It is believed that the future Internet is going to provide us the framework to integrate, control or operate virtually any device, appliance,monitoring systems, infrastructures etc. In this talk, we first present the concept of cyber-physical systems and various research challenges from several application perspectives. Finally, we present several adaptive representations for understanding all types of complex data from text to graphs networks. </p>

                  <h3><strong>Understanding People, Culture and Context as the basis for ICT development</strong></h3>

                  <p>In this talk I will discuss ICT interventions that work and fail and the reasons that people accept or reject new technologies. I will draw upon case studies from both marginalized and mainstream communities in developed and developing countries.<br>
                    I will also discuss how we use people centered approaches to define and develop our significant research projects in the area of emerging technologies, many of which are funded by the Australian Research Council Discovery program:</p>
                  <p>(a) Designing the Internet of Things to engage the ageing population; and</p>
                  <p>(b)  Crowdsourcing recreational birdwatchers to analyze big environmental data.</p>

                  <p>Technology is used in all educational contexts (online and blended education) and especially in learning activities, both for teaching (the point of view of the teacher) and for learning (the point of view of the learner). Thus, assessment is becoming ever increasingly important and interactive tools are needed to facilitate it. Learning technologies open new opportunities for more personalized, authentic, and engaging assessment experiences. However, the use of digital technologies for assessment, referred to as Technology-Enhanced Assessment (TEA), has yet to transform most of the current practices which often replicate traditional assessment methods. In particular, to generalize new experiences and ways to conduct assessment, deliver feedback and enhance the learning experience is a main challenge. The potential of TEA brings to technologists, educators and designers very valued challenges and opportunities to explore.</p>

                  <h3><strong>Health Information Exchange in the wake of &lsquo;big data&rsquo; paradigm – the theme is from </strong>&lsquo;<em>quality of information to quality of life</em>&rsquo;</h3>
                  <p><strong><a href="http://www.icter.org/conference/node/376"><img alt="" class="float-left" src="http://www.icter.org/conference/sites/default/files//profilepic/tony.jpg">Dr Tony Sahama</a>,</strong>  Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology.</p>
                  <p>Health Information Exchange (HIE) is an interesting phenomenon. It is a patient centric health and/or medical information management scenario enhanced by integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).  While health information systems are repositioning complex system directives, in the wake of the &lsquo;big data&rsquo; paradigm, extracting quality information is challenging.</p>
                  <p>It is anticipated that in this talk, ICT enabled healthcare scenarios with big data analytics will be shared. In addition, research and development regarding big data analytics, such as current trends of using these technologies for health care services and critical research challenges when extracting quality of information to improve quality of life will be discussed</p>
